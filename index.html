										In my two years as a Life Insurance Manager at PNB MetLife, I focused heavily on understanding my clients' unique needs and guiding them toward the right insurance solutions. My role was not just about meeting sales targets but about building lasting relationships, which I believe is key in the insurance industry. I worked closely with my team to drive performance, setting strategies that improved client acquisition and retention.

I also had a strong focus on compliance, ensuring all processes adhered to industry regulations, and maintained a high standard of service. This experience strengthened my skills in communication, negotiation, and market analysis, giving me a well-rounded foundation in financial services. It was a role that required balancing empathy with business acumen, something I found both challenging and rewarding.
